# java-uni-project-connect4
Uni project to create an interactive connect 4 game using java

We were each given a single baseline file for a connect 4 game that was incomplete and contained errors so it would not compile. Working individually, we were tasked with rewriting the project to form a functional game between human players or a human and computer player (where the computer player simply makes choices at random). The game had to be able to handle incorrect inputs and work as a complete connect 4 game from start to finish. MyConnectFour.java containes the main code for the game, and allows easy modification for different board sizes and combinations of computer or human players.
